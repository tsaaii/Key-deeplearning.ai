What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?

Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.

Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)

Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
( Example: Ads by Google, recommendations by Amazon and Speech recognition softwares of Google,Apple,IBM)
We have access to a lot more computational power.
We have access to a lot more data.

Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)

Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).

When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
